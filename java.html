    <h1>Java Programming</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Java</strong> is a powerful and widely-used programming language.
      It helps in building <em>web</em>, <em>mobile</em>, and
      <em>desktop</em> applications. Java is known for its simplicity, security,
      and cross-platform capabilities.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Java Virtual Machine </h2>
    <p>
      The <mark>Java Virtual Machine</mark> is the engine that runs Java
      bytecode. It allows Java programs to run on any operating system without
      modification. This is what makes Java "write once, run anywhere."
    </p>

    <h2>2. Java Development Kit </h2>
    <p>
      The <b>JDK</b> is a software development kit that provides all the tools
      needed to write, compile, and run Java programs. It includes the compiler
      (<i>javac</i>), the Java libraries, and other development tools.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Java Runtime Environment </h2>
    <p>
      <em>JRE</em> is used to run Java applications. It includes the JVM and
      core libraries, but it does not have development tools like the compiler.
      It's useful when you only want to run, not develop, Java programs.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Variables</h2>
    <p>
      Variables are used to store information in a program. Each variable has a
      <b>data type</b> that defines what kind of data it can hold. For example:
      <i>int number = 5;</i>
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Types</h2>
    <p>Java has two main categories of data types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Primitive:</b> int, float, double, boolean, char</li>
      <li><b>Non-primitive:</b> String, Arrays, Classes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Using the right data type helps manage memory and improves performance.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Conditional Statements</h2>
    <p>
      Conditional statements let you make decisions in your program. For
      example:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i
        >If the user is logged in, show the dashboard. Otherwise, show the login
        screen.</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Java supports <strong>if</strong>, <strong>else if</strong>,
      <strong>else</strong>, and <strong>switch</strong> statements.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Loops</h2>
    <p>Loops let you run the same block of code multiple times. Java has:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>for loop:</b> when the number of repetitions is known</li>
      <li><b>while loop:</b> when the condition is checked before the loop</li>
      <li><b>do-while loop:</b> when the loop should run at least once</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Arrays</h2>
    <p>
      An <mark>array</mark> is a collection of elements of the same type. It
      allows you to store multiple values under one variable name.
    </p>
    <p>For example: <i>int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};</i></p>
    <p>
      Arrays are useful for storing lists, such as student names or product
      prices.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Methods</h2>
    <p>
      A <strong>method</strong> is a block of code that performs a specific
      task. You can call a method whenever you need to run that task.
    </p>
    <p>Methods help break your program into smaller, reusable pieces.</p>
    <p>Example: <i>public void greet() { System.out.println("Hello!"); }</i></p>

    <h2>10. Classes and Objects</h2>
    <p>
      Java is based on <b>object-oriented programming</b>. A
      <strong>class</strong> defines a template for objects, and an
      <strong>object</strong> is an instance of a class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: A class <i>Car</i> can have objects like <i>car1</i> and
      <i>car2</i> with different colors and speeds.
