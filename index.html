    <h1>Kawasaki</h1>
    <p>
      At the time of its release, the W1 was <b>Japan’s</b> largest-displacement
      motorcycle, and boasted top-level horsepower. Designed to be the fastest,
      most powerful machines of their day, Kawasaki’s W Series models are now
      better known for a beauty that never goes out of style, and the rich
      character of an air-cooled engine. To this day, Japan’s original
      <i>big bikes</i> continue to command a <strong>respect</strong> . To ride
      a W is to feel the pride of being connected to such
      <em>illustrious</em> roots.
